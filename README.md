# English 035: The Rise of the Novel and the Rise of Social Media at Swarthmore College, Fall 2018
## Syllabus, assignments, computer-assisted text analysis exercises, and others materials for a mid-level undergraduate course on the history of the novel in English

This course engages with the long history of the novel, stretching from its eighteenth-century origins to its Victorian and Modernist incarnations through its post-colonial and post-modernist reconfigurations, with particular attention paid to the novel's production, circulation, reception, and materiality, and to digital methods for analyzing both individual texts and larger corpora. It includes some consideration of continuities and differences between novelistic forms and the forms of social media. See the course [syllabus](/Syllabus/rise_2018_syllabus.md) for a more extended overview of the major concerns and theoretical frameworks engaged in this course.

[Assignments](/Assignments) includes instructions and materials for a series of computationally-assisted text analysis exercises, along with material contextualizing these exercises within various literary-critical debates regarding the novel, scholarly canons, and the digital humanities. One of these exercises will has been developed and will be taught in collaboration with [Richard Wicentowski](https://www.cs.swarthmore.edu/~richardw/) (Swarthmore, Computer Science) and will be carried out through a collaboration between students in CS65: Natural Language Processing and students in this class.
