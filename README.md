# English 035: The Rise of the Novel and the Rise of Social Media at Swarthmore College, Fall 2018
## Syllabus, assignments, computer-assisted text analysis exercises, and others materials for a mid-level undergraduate course on the history of the novel in English

This course engages with the long history of the novel in English, stretching from its eighteenth-century origins to its Victorian and Modernist incarnations through its post-colonial and post-modernist reconfigurations, with particular attention paid to the novel's production, circulation, reception, and materiality, and to digital methods for analyzing both individual texts and larger corpora. See the course [syllabus](/Syllabus/Rise2018Syllabus.md) for a more extended overview of the major concerns and theoretical frameworks engaged in this course.

In addition to offering a full history of the novel, his class will test the idea that some of the most important functions the novel performed in the past are carried on today not by novels, but by social media practices and platforms. With the help of major theorists of novelistic form from the last half-century, we will consider the status update, the snap, and the tweet as the latest iterations in a three-century experiment in representing everyday life. It was through novels that readers learned to think of themselves as worthy of narrative; it was through novels that readers learned to imagine other minds and to imagine that they were held in mind by others. It was through novels that readers learned to think of their societies as observed and themselves as seen.

[Assignments](/Assignments) includes instructions and materials for a series of computationally-assisted text analysis exercises, along with material contextualizing these exercises within various literary-critical debates regarding the novel, scholarly canons, and the digital humanities. One of these exercises will has been developed and will be taught in collaboration with [Richard Wicentowski](https://www.cs.swarthmore.edu/~richardw/) (Swarthmore, Computer Science) and will be carried out through a collaboration between students in CS65: Natural Language Processing and students in this class.
