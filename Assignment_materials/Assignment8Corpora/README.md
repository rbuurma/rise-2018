### Corpora
In order to compare Austen's works with some other collections of fiction in Exercise 8 we have developed the set of texts and groups of texts here.

#### Canon
The “canon” collection contains 44 works of eighteenth- and early-nineteenth-century fiction that are taught frequently in university-level classes on the novel and fiction; we drew them from a survey of 40 recent syllabi. They are Pamela (1740), Tristram Shandy (1749), Evelina (1778), Robinson Crusoe (1719), Tom Jones (1749), Joseph Andrews (1742), Oroonoko, or The Royal Slave (1688), Moll Flanders (1722), Northanger Abbey (1817), Shamela (1741), Clarissa (1748)

(Love in Excess (1719) is on this list but not included because of the lack of a readily available machine-readable text.)

#### Archive
We have two corpora that stand in for the “archive” or - to use the words of Margaret Cohen - “the great unread” (“Narratology in the Archive of Literature,” 61) - all of those books that were published and (possibly) read at one time but which have not been.

##### Chawton
CHAWTON, our first “archive” corpus, is a collection of 75 novels drawn from the Chawton House Library’s Novels Online project, which contains little-known novels written (primarily) by women and published during the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries.

##### Singer-Mendenhall
A alternate model for “archive” is SINGERMENDENHALL. This corpus contains seventy-five rare works of eighteenth-century fiction drawn from the Singer-Mendenhall collection at the University of Pennsylvania.

#### Some additions

See also our collection of the novels of Samuel Richardson, a collection of parodies of Richardson's novel *Pamela* and some works by Daniel Defoe for touchstones of earlier eigtheenth-century novels and novelists.
