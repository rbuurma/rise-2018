# Plain-text authoring: underneath the digital text  (Exercise 4b)

Complete if possible by Wednesday, October 11.

In assignment 4 , we learned about how we move from a eighteenth-century book on a library shelf to a digitized image of that book to a machine-readable text.

But what about a so-called born-digital text - a Microsoft Word document, or a website? All we will do in this exercise is upzip a Word file and look at the encoding behind a simple website to see how the text we read on a webpage or Microsoft Word document is "marked up" or encoded with information about style. When an eigtheenth-century printer typesets a manuscript, as we discussed in class, he or she makes decisions about what type to use, how the lay out a page, where to break lines, how to paginate, with how heavy a hand to ink and roll. Digital platforms and tools have different ways of allowing us to give the text in our head material form. Here are two to take a look at.

### Decoding a web page

How does a computer know what to display on your computer screen when you navigate to a particular site? To look at the encoding or "source" of any web page, navigate to the page in the browser of your choice:

In Chrome, go to View > Developer > View source.

or

In Firefox, go to Tools > Webdeveloper > Page source.

or

In Safari, go to Safari menu > Preferences > Advanced. Check "Show Develop menu in menu bar." Close the Preferences window. Go to the Develop menu > Show Page Source

---

Can you find the text you read on the webpage? What else do you see? What is it doing?

When I was testing this, I arbitrarily used the academia.edu and found something interesting; take a look.

### Upzipping Word

Word documents seem simple when we create them and look at them, but when we write a Word document we are actually creating a very complex stack of individual documents, each of which is responsible for encoding information about how the document looks when we open it.

Create a Word document, type a few lines into it, and save it to your computer.

In your Finder, navigate to the document and change the .docx extension to .zip.

Click or double-click on the zip file to unpack it. What do you see? If you like, try opening some of the files you see.

If you don't have Word or can't unzip, no worries; we will show an example in class.
