## Bibliographic Description Project

This assignment draws on what you learned in [Exercise 5](https://github.com/rbuurma/rise-2015/blob/master/Rise_assignment_5.md) about the relation of *Evelina* to other new novels published in the 1770s. It asks you to narrow your focus to a single novel published between 1776 and 1779 - choose one that you have come across in the course of Exercise 5, or choose a different eighteenth-century novel that appears on ECCO, Googlebook, or HathiTrust if you like. (Make sure that you locate all of the volumes of the novel you choose before proceeding! )You will create two very different types of description of this book.  We will create a virtual gallery of these descriptions to share with each other, the Swarthmore community, and the public.

Part 1 walks you through how to do a basic traditional bibliographic description, using text only; Part 2 asks you to produce another kind of description of the same book.

Deadlines:

Nov 6: Traditional descriptive bibliography draft due (post to Known)
Nov 10: Experimental descriptive bibliography plan due (one paragraph, post to Known)
Nov 29: Final bibliography projects due, presentations!

### Part 1: Traditional Bibliographic Description

There are many ways to format a bibliographic description.  Look at Raven and Tanselle for models. There is latitude within these guidelines. (You will not be including much of the detail Tanselle includes, for example.)

+ Create a short summary of bibliographic information for you to head up this bibliographical entry; it could look something like:
Austen, Jane. Mansfield Park. 2nd ed. London: Murray, 1816. (It might be more interesting, e.g. 2nd ed, 3rd impression, reissue - and so on).
    + Then, start with a quasi-facsimile transcription of the title page. This comes straight after the heading - the "entry" for this book - and does not get its own subheading. I would sum up the rules for this as follows:
	+ Transcribe every little thing you see.
	+ Do not worry about size or type of font. I do not want you to represent large or small point sizes, or gothic as opposed to roman type); do indicate difference between lower and upper case, italic and non-italic font type.
	+ Ornaments are simply measured height x width in mm and described in [square brackets].
	+ Remember to put each new line after a | and if you see a | represent it as an ornament. / is a virgule – represent it using /. Use [...] for omissions where each period represents letter that might be missing; but if you find square brackets on the page from which you are working, find differently formatted ones
+ Next, make a note of the way the book is paginated, volume by volume; see examples in the Raven bibliography for guidance. Some pages have roman numerals. Represent these accordingly (so viii if the book contains seven Roman-numeral pages before the Arabic numbering).
+ The next thing to do is to determine format. You might want to start by counting the number of leaves in each gathering. Find a gathering by signature - it will be signed A, A2, A3, for instance, and the next gathering will start at B. Find a gathering, too, by looking for the string that has stitched it into the binding (remember the gatherings in manuscripts: the principle is the same): it will be in the very middle of the gathering.  Count the leaves in a mid-book gathering, not the preliminaries.
Once you have figured out how many pages in each gathering, remember the main clues for format:
+ Folio, or 2mo will be gathered in 2s, 4s, 6s or 8s (that is, two, four, etc leaves).
+ Quarto, or 4mo,  will be gathered in 4s, 8s (or rarely, if it was imposed on halfsheets, 2s).
+ Octavo, 8mo, will usually be gathered in 8s
+ Duodecimo, or 12mo,  will usually be gathered in 12s

+ Contents - the next thing I want you to do is the account of the book's content. Contents have their own subheading. Describing them is pretty easy: use the signature series and note where the following appear:
	+ any blanks
	+ title
	+ half title (extra title page in front of title page, quite common)
	+ advertisements
	+ dedication
	+ preface
	+ text
	+ index
and so on. Represent these as in the following example: A1r title, A1v blank, A2r-v dedication, A3r -Z1v text, Z2r-v advertisement.

+ Notes form the last section, and have their own heading. In general, you need to list all of the copies consulted. In fact, you are consulting but one: so under this heading give the location of the actual book (the copy the digital facsimile was scanned from, which ECCO will note) and then the identifying information ECCO gives for the facsimile. Then take a note of anything interesting that would be true of all copies of this book - in the prefatory material, etc. (See the examples, below, for a guide.) Note also anything interesting that is copy specific, such as binding, book-plates, marginalia, old prices, and so on – that seems to be specific to your copy of this book.

You will want to format your descriptive bibliography using simple Markdown; I will offer a basic introduction to using Markdown in class next week.

Post a draft of your traditional descriptive bibliography to Known by Monday, November 3rd.

### Part 2: Experimental Bibliographic Description

Now that you have had experience creating a very codified bibliographic description using a specific set of rules. I would like you to produce a different kind of description of your chosen novel in the medium of your choice. Think about the different forms of descriptive and representational practices of other academic disciplines and of everyday life, as well as of bibliographic description. What does bibliographic description leave out or not capture? What new or borrowed descriptive mode or medium might you use in order to offer a different account of your novel?  Does the traditional bibliographic description capture the difference between a printed book and a digital facsimile of a printed book? If not, can you invent a descriptive modes that would? We will create a virtual gallery of these descriptions, set alongside your traditional bibliographic descriptions, to share with each other.

If you would like to look at some examples, see riseofthenovel.swarthmore.edu . (The beautiful custom Omeka theme for the site was designed and built by Swarthmore ITS's own Michael Kappeler.)

Post a paragraph about your plan for your experimental descriptive bibliography to Known by Monday, November 10th. We will have a tutorial on how to format and upload your project.

*The entire project should be uploaded to our Rise of the Novel Omeka site and available for presentation by Sunday, December 3rd.*

### Important Notes

If you wish to describe a physical copy of your chosen book instead of a digital facsimile I will try to make some times for you to travel to Penn's rare book library to see them. If you want to do this, make sure that Penn has a first or early edition of the book you are working with by searching the Penn Library's catalog, [Franklin](http://franklin.library.upenn.edu/).
